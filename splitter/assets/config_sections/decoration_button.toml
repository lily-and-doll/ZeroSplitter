# Adds a toggle in the top bar that turns off window decorations, e.g.
# the title bar and side bars. When the decorations are hidden, you
# can move the window by dragging it anywhere but cannot resize it
# manually.
# Known issue: right clicking the window when decorations are hidden
# makes dragging no longer work. Turn them back on and drag the 
# title bar to fix it.
